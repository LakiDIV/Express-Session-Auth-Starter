This repository provides a starter template for session-based user authentication using Passport.js in an Express.js application. It includes a basic setup for user registration and login routes, along with password hashing and salting for secure storage. The project uses MongoDB as a database, with Mongoose for object modeling.

The repository is structured to separate concerns, with authentication middleware, password utilities, and configuration files each in their own modules. This makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

Please note that while this setup provides a solid foundation for personal projects, additional security considerations may be necessary for enterprise-grade applications. This repository is primarily intended for educational purposes to demonstrate the basics of session-based authentication in Express.js.

To get started with this repository, simply clone it, install the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file using `npm i`, and run the server. 

Happy coding!
